# Kek3d

Kek3d is a graphics engine I'm developing using OpenGL and C++. It's express purpose is to be used to animate the process of Stable Diffusion on Terrain and to implement a interior decorating game.

Kek3d has originally been created using Visual Studio 2022 on Windows. To compile, please use CMake to create a build for whatever system you are currently running on. 

## Build

Kek3d is currently a WIP project, so the current state of building will be a bit messy. The project will soon be refactored to support git submodules for required externals and CMake.
